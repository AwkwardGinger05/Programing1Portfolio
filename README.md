# Certifications:
This year I was thankfully able to recieve my first quarter certification in basic coding knowledge and barley missed getting my language certification with a 79%

# Chess Game

During my Junior year at Skyline Highschool a group of 4 students (myslef included) tackled out final projcet of a chess game clone. We were unable to get any logic behind the valid moves and capturing but we were able to secure moving images, snapping, turn based actions, and array lists. My part of this project revolved around being able to add and create the images for the game as well as help around with the main code as much as I was able.

## Semester 1

**Spaceship Game**

The spaceship game was the first time in class we had attempted to create a fully functioning program based on the game Space Invaders. We had a mouse controlled space ship that would fire lazers on a click on the mouse or a push of a button. The lazers would be aimed at monster that decended from the top of the screen, disapearing and causing the player to lose a bit of their score. Damage, health poitions, and an increase in level difficulty was all added into the game. It was a very fun project and one that I hope to finish in the future.

**Calculator**

The calculator application was a fun way that my class used arrays to create a fully functioning calculator that could receive input by a push a botton on the calculator. It would display the numbers and symbols that the user had added and would return the answer on screen after the equals button was pressed.

**Screen Saver App**

The screen saver app was an application we created early on to demonstrate how to create random movement on a screen, random color selection, and border detection. We created a random class that would have a line draw across the screen in a certain derection for a random amount of time before randomly changing the direction again and again. If the line ever reached the border of the screen we would have it move to a random location on the screen and continue to move around until the user exited the application. It ended up creating these wonderful screen savers that a lot of us used as wallpaper on our computers after we made them.

**EtchASketch**

Similarly to the screen saver app we created a digital version of the classic EtchASketch that we could use to draw images on our screen. We had a line that would go in the direction of our arrow keys up until the point that the user stops pressing down. It would leave a black trail behind it and would only be able to clear once the game was reset.

**Cars**

Cars was another fun application we created using random classes. We created little cars out of shapes and had the code spawn a car randomly on the far left or right on the screen moving in a random horizontal line at a random speed. I chose to also randomize the colors of the cars creating a crazy and colorful image that would continously run 100 cars around at a time.

## Semester 2

**99 Bottles**

99 bottles was the first application I made within the language of Java. Up until this point we were using an application called Processing to do the majority of our code within. Now we were able to work stricktly in java and I was able to create an while loop to count down the numbers from 99 to 1 using the phrase "___ bottles of beer on the wall, ___ bottles of beer. Take one down pass it around". It would loop all the way until 1 where the code could catch that it had gotten to the last number and the phrase would change "1 bottle of beer on the way, 1 bottle of beer. Take one down pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall". (forgive the spelling mistakes, I'm a programmer not enlgish major lol)
